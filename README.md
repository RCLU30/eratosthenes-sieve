# Simple Sieve of Eratosthenes

A simple Python implementation of the Sieve of Eratostheens; an algorithm for finding the prime numbers smaller than a given number

## Getting Started

The simple Python script just contains a function that returns a list of prime numbers smaller than a given input. 

## How to run
Run the simple Python script by running the following command in the command terminal:
```
python eratosthenes_sieve.py
```

Currently the program will print to the console a list of primes smaller than 100.

Modify the "eratosthenes_sieve.py" script to fit your needs
